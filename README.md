# Jupyter Notebooks
Collection of Jupiter Notebooks I have made. This could be anything from Code Alongs to Model Testing

1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning** - Followed a Tutorial on how to build a Deep Reinforcement Learning Model using Deep Q Learning. This was done on the Cartpole Game.

2. **Text Classification** - I built a bag of words deep learning model that handles text classification with 80%+ accuracy.

3. **Testing AutoViz** - I tested out a new Python package, AutoViz, against a couple of different datasets. Results were interesting.

4. **CycleGAN Explained** - My attempt at explaining the CycleGAN paper in my own words as simply as possible.

5. **Currency Predictor** - I found a sample assignment online that looked interesting. Involves exploring JPY/USD price pair over time in an attempt to find a trading pattern.

6. **Currency Predictor PT2** - Here I took the information learned in PT1 and used that to clean up my code and simulate some strategies
