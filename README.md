# Jupyter Notebooks
Collection of Jupiter Notebooks I have made. This could be anything from Code Alongs to Model Testing

1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning** - Followed a Tutorial on how to build a Deep Reinforcement Learning Model using Deep Q Learning. This was done on the Cartpole Game.

2. **Text Classification** - I built a bag of words deep learning model that handles text classification with 80%+ accuracy.

3. **Testing AutoViz** - I tested out a new Python package, AutoViz, against a couple of different datasets. Results were interesting.

4. **CycleGAN Explained** - My attempt at explaining the CycleGAN paper in my own words as simply as possible.

5. **Currency Predictor** - I found a sample assignment online that looked interesting. Involves exploring JPY/USD price pair over time in an attempt to find a trading pattern.

6. **Currency Predictor PT2** - Here I took the information learned in PT1 and used that to clean up my code and simulate some strategies

7. **Lawmaker Tracking Data Preprocessing** - There is a movement online of traders tracking the trades that lawmakers make in order to attempt to copy inside trading. My strategy is a little bit different. I am not sure whether or not lawmakers are inside trading, but I am certain that there is a movement of people that are making trades based on that information. My theory is there will be a jump in each stock as the time of discloser due to this wave of people buying. Potentially selling aswell. If I can find that pattern, there is something I can consistently trade on.

8. **Lawmaker Tracking Exploratory Analysis** - Continuation of **Lawmaker Tracking Data Preprocessing** 

9. **BASALT 2022 Item Classifier** - Helped my BASALT 2022 Competition submission but training a model to recognize the items in a minecraft inventory using solely a jpg of the screen. 

10. **BASALT 2022 Item Quantity Classifier** - Helped my BASALT 2022 Competition submission but training a model to recognize each item's quantity in a minecraft inventory using solely a jpg of the screen.
