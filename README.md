# JupyterNotebooks
Collection of Jupiter Notebooks I have made. This could be anything from Code Alongs to Model Testing

1. **Deep Reinforcement Learning** - Followed a Tutorial on how to build a Deep Reinforcement Learning Model using Deep Q Learning. This was done on the Cartpole Game.

2. **Text Classification** - I built a bag of words deep learning model that handles text classification with 80%+ accuracy.
